# Connhex CLI

A command-line interface tool for interacting with [Connhex](https://connhex.com?utm_campaign=content&utm_medium=web&utm_source=github&utm_content=connhex+cli) Cloud.

## Overview

Connhex CLI allows you to interact with your Connhex Cloud instance directly from your terminal. It provides commands for authentication, configuration management, device provisioning, etc.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or later

### Building from source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/compiuta-origin/connhex-cli.git
   cd connhex-cli
   ```

2. Build the CLI:
   ```bash
   make cli
   ```

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> This guide assumes the `connhex-cli` binary is globally available (i.e. stored in a directory that has been added to your `PATH`. Common choices are `/usr/local/bin` or a custom directory like `~/.bin`.)

If this is not your case, navigate to the folder containing the `connhex-cli` binary. You will then be able to execute all of the commands below by replacing `connhex-cli` with `./connhex-cli`.

### Authentication

Before using Connhex CLI, you need to authenticate with your Connhex instance:

```bash
connhex-cli login
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- Your Connhex instance domain
- Email address
- Password

Alternatively, you can provide all parameters in a single command:

```bash
connhex-cli login <connhex-instance> <email> <password>
```

Authentication tokens are stored in `~/.connhex/config.json` and are valid for 24 hours.

### View Configuration

To check your current configuration:

```bash
connhex-cli config
```

This will display your Connhex instance, authentication token, and other settings.

## Device Provisioning

### Bulk Device Provisioning

You can [provision](https://connhex.com/docs/api/core/provision/provision-a-connectable?utm_campaign=content&utm_medium=web&utm_source=github&utm_content=connhex+cli) multiple devices at once using a CSV or JSON file:

```bash
connhex-cli provision [--schema=<schema-name>] [--serial-number-field=<field-name>] [--connhex-id-field=<field-name>] <filename>
```

#### Flags

- `--schema`
  Manufacturing device schema to use (default: `devices`).

- `--serial-number-field`
  Manufacturing device serial number field (default: `serial_number`).

- `--connhex-id-field`
  Manufacturing device Connhex ID field (default: `connhex_id`).

#### File Formats

Both CSV and JSON formats are supported.

##### CSV Format

CSV files must have a header row. The only required column is:

- `provision.init_id` - Device initialization ID (typically the device serial number)

Optional columns:

- `provision.init_key` - Device initialization key. If omitted, a UUID v4 is generated automatically.
- `tenant` - Target tenant. If omitted, devices are provisioned without a tenant.
- `provision.name` - Device name.
- `provision.model` - Device model (must be a valid UUID).
- `provision.migration_key` - Alternative key used by the device to download its configuration if the main key is not available.
- `provision.migration_key_quota` - The number of times the migration key can be used.

All custom [manufacturing](https://connhex.com/docs/manufacturing/intro?utm_campaign=content&utm_medium=web&utm_source=github&utm_content=connhex+cli) data columns use the prefix `manufacturing.` followed by the field name. These will depend on your Connhex Manufacturing [configuration](https://connhex.com/docs/manufacturing/default-configuration?utm_campaign=content&utm_medium=web&utm_source=github&utm_content=connhex+cli).

> [!NOTE]
> The serial number field in the manufacturing record (default: `serial_number`) is always set automatically from `provision.init_id`. Do not include it as a `manufacturing.*` column.

Example CSV file:

```csv
tenant,provision.init_id,provision.init_key,provision.name
connhex,SN123456789,f1d1fa88-3da4-46db-b0c4-f003d4594cc8,Sensor 1
connhex,SN123456790,cc8d42e1-063c-48aa-8fd8-1f983b4f2b54,Sensor 2
```

##### JSON Format

The JSON file should contain an array of device objects:

```json
[
  {
    "tenant": "connhex",
    "provision": {
      "name": "Sensor 1",
      "init_id": "SN123456789",
      "init_key": "f1d1fa88-3da4-46db-b0c4-f003d4594cc8"
    },
    "manufacturing": {}
  }
]
```

## Configuration

The Connhex CLI stores its configuration in `~/.connhex/config.json`. This includes:

- `connhex_instance`: Your Connhex instance domain
- `token`: Authentication token
- `user`: User email
- `expires_at`: Token expiration timestamp

## Troubleshooting

_I'm getting the following error: `error: failed to create entity`_

Make sure all fields in your `devices` CSV file are valid: common errors include specifying tenants or models that don't exist.

_I'm getting the following error: `cmd/main.go:5:2: package slices is not in GOROOT`_

Make sure your Go version is 1.20+.
